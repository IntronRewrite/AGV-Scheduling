## 1. Abstract

To improve the efficiency of automated container terminals, optimizing the scheduling of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is essential. Traditional AGV strategies often overlook the issue of empty runs. In contrast, the proposed model aims to minimize the empty runs of AGVs by ensuring each AGV unloads a container at the yard and immediately loads another container before returning to the quay. The key contributions of this study include the integration of weight constraints and time windows into the scheduling model, addressing both the safety and efficiency of AGV operations. A constraint penalty strategy is employed to handle overweight container tasks, and time windows are used to define the loading and unloading sequence for each container, considering the vesselâ€™s berthing time and the operational requirements of the yard. Using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with penalty functions, the model is solved to obtain the minimum operating time for AGVs. Experimental results using simulated data provided the optimal AGV scheduling sequences, with the GA demonstrating certain advantages over other algorithms. The simulation data and code are available on GitHub for further validation and research.

**Note:** This experiment was conducted using two different machines. As a result, the processing time may vary between machines. To obtain accurate experimental processing time, we reran the program. Therefore, there are minor discrepancies between the data in the GitHub tables and the results presented in the paper. Additionally, due to the nature of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the results may slightly differ between experiments. Therefore, the provided runtime and result values are for reference only.


## 5. Conclusions

To enhance the safety and transport efficiency of the terminal, the model aims to minimize the empty trip rate of AGVs by focusing on their operation at full capacity. The focus is on the safe transport and efficiency of AGVs, striving to control overload situations and reduce operational time. We employ a GA with penalty functions and design constraints including fully loaded constraints, weight restrictions, and time windows. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively addresses this issue and identifies the optimal transport sequence for AGVs. When compared with algorithms based on HPSO and SA, GA exhibits superior performance. However, the model established requires an equal number of containers to be unloaded and loaded. When encountering unequal situations, it is necessary to split them into several equally sized task groups for study to ensure the applicability and accuracy of the model. Moreover, this experiment involved three algorithms, and in the future, we will consider introducing more heuristic algorithms to improve the precision and efficiency of problem-solving.
